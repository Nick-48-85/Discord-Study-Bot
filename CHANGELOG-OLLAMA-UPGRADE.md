# Ollama Service Update

This commit consolidates the Ollama API integration by making `ollama.py` the single source for Ollama functionality.

## Changes

- Merged enhanced functionality from `ollama_enhanced.py` into `ollama.py`
- Updated all imports across the codebase to use `ollama.py` directly
- Maintained backward compatibility with `OllamaEnhancedService` as an alias
- Removed redundant files and backups
- Updated example scripts to use the consolidated service

## Benefits

- Simplified codebase with a single service implementation
- Consistent temperature control based on prompt type
- Improved JSON response parsing and error handling
- All features available through a unified API

This change completes the migration outlined in `services/migration_plan.md`.
